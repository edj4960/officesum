# officesum

## Description

This is a placeholder text generator that utilizes commedic quotes from the show 'The Office'. This is a for fun project and was made using React.js and SASS.

The app utilizes React context providers to handle delegating timed themed changes and the generating and displaying of randomized quotes.

Potential future improvements:

* Mobile support
* Selecting which show characters to use for generating quotes
* Toggling the display of character names
* Option to only display one-liners or multi-line quotes
* User controlled image/theme updating (maybe via clicking on image)

## Usage

```;
npm install
```

```;
npm run start
```
